<div class="box1">
<h3 style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">Stromkar, The WarBreaker</h3>
<p style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">This greatsword was borne into combat by the barbarian warlord who first united humanity under a single banner, founding the nation of Arathor. A master tactician and strategist, King Thoradin went on to play a critical role in ending the Troll Wars. Later the sword was lost while it was being used to subdue a C'Thraxxi monstrosity in a forgotten tomb beneath Tirisfal. Abandoned and all but forgotten, Stromakar has been slowly drinking from the shadowy power there over thousands of years. Now, its power had been unleashed...

<div class="box2">
<h3 style="color:rgb(0,255,0)">Aluneth, Greatstaff Of The Magna</h3>
<p style="color:rgb(0,255,0)">Aluneth was most notably wielded for a time by AEgwynn, the only female Guardian of Tirisfal, although stories indicate that it is far older than she. She is said to have found the staff roughly a century after she took up the mantle of Guardian, and to have wielded Aluneth in many battles aginst the Burning Legion. Several years before relinquishing her title, she retired the staff, but none know where she might have stored it. But seem like it had been discovered by the wrong "person"...

<div class="box3">
<h3 style="color:rgb(0,225,255)">Thas'dorah, Legacy Of The Windrunners</h3>
<p style="color:rgb(0,225,255)">A proud heirloom of the Windrunner family, Thas'dorah was carved from a bough of the mother tree of Eversong Woods shortly after the elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas was founded, Handed down to the eldest of each generation, the bow was last wielded by the high elf Ranger Captain Alleria Windrunner. It disappeared along with its owner following the destruction of the orcs' homeworld, Draenor, and the subsequent formation of Outland. From the trace that this prisoner had left on the "crystal" prison, it might had the ability to jump through different dimensions. The bow was devoured by the creatures in the outland, so it might break over through the "walls" and take it back from there.
